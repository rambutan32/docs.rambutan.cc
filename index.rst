Rambutan Documentation Overview
===============================

Rambutan is project for open STM32 microcontroller tools, based on Leaflab's
libmaple firmware library. These tools and libraries are intended to make it
easier to build embedded electronics projects using low-cost, low-power ARM
Cortex-M3/M4 family microcontrollers.

Eventually this location will be a catch-all for systems-level integration
instructions, tutorials, and example projects, but for now it's simply a (very
short) index of sub-project documentation links.
